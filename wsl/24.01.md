# Ubuntu 24.01

- installed from the microsoft store. this option is not available in SLB as the microsoft store in banned.

## PATH

- a lot of windows folders are mounted
- both user and system environment varaibles are in ubuntu PATH
- these are all added after linux bin folders

## git on wsl

- git came preinstalled
- to commmit, i had to setup global user.email and user.name. git output showed the commands.

  ```bash
  git config --global user.email "wise.dev45@outlook.com"
  git config --global user.name "kapil sinha"
  ```

- to my surprise sync including push worked without any additional settings. it should have asked me for my github username, password or credentials. lets try after removing generic credentials from windows crednetials of credential manager.
  - sync still worked.
  - even after restarting wsl and vs code sync still worked.
  - github desktop on windows failed and it asked to login on browser. it means ubuntu git is using some other mechanism.

## vscode

- settings from the previous wsl dont exist here
- all extensions are also missing
- running code command worked but it first downloaded the vscode
