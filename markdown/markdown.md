# markdown stuff

- headers, sections and subtitles, titles using hashes (#)
- lists start with minus and space. This is an example.
- numbered list start with one. all elements number must start with one. Below is an example

1. *One*
1. **Two**
1. Three

- nested numbered lists example is below

1. One
    1. one.one
    1. one.two
1.Two
    1. two.one
    1. two.two
1. Three

- write block of code using three backticks

```python
import os
print(os.name)
```

- inline code is single backtick `if name == __main__`
- don't know why but here is quotes

- line breaks are not easy. You can keep typing here in multiple lines but 
its all of no use unless you end line with 2+ spaces  
First Line  
Second Line

- link is created using square brackets followed by parenthesis. Visible text is inside square brackets and url is inside the parenthesis

- horizontal line to make things nicer - three minus signs?

---

- escape special characters using backslash `(\)`. there are many characters that one need to escape. escape because they are important to markdown

| character | name |
|------------|----------|
| \* | star |
| \\ | backslash |

- that is also an example of table
