## Network ACL

subnets have network ACLs. Each and every message that crosses subnet boundary is checked against NACL.

each EC2 instances has a security group. security group can allow HTTPS  traffic for websites and reject all other traffic.

security group checks only at entry. NACL are checked at both entry and exit.

NACL are stateless

Security groups are stateful. return traffic is allowed.

In a VPC, you can define rules to allow resources in different subnets to communicate with each other.

The permissions defined by the network ACLs indicate what is allowed or denied. It is based on who sent the packet and how the packet is trying to communicate with the resources in a subnet.
